[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) is a dynamic and functional dialect of Lisp
that runs on the JVM.

It is unlikely that an entire system would be written in Clojure. However, if
Java is already in use and some aspects lend themselves to a functional style
then Clojure will slot in most easily. It could also be simply viewed as a tool
to learn the concepts of functional programming rather than being used directly
in production. We therefore place it in assess.
