[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open-source distributed event
streaming platform boasting:

- High throughput
- High availability
- Scalable

It is widely used across many industries to support data pipelines, streaming
analytics and more.

As part of the ESS-in-kind work ISIS developed a data streaming architecture
for experimental data based on Kafka.
A similar system has been implemented at ISIS with experimental data being
published to Kafka topics. It is for this reason it has been placed in adopt.
