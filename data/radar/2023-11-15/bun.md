[Bun](https://bun.sh) is a new Javascript toolkit including a:

- JavaScript runtime
- transpiler: run TypeScript files directly
- bundler
- test runner
- Node.js-compatible package manager.

It provides and all-in-one solution to replace many common JavaScript-based project
tools with the added benefit of much improved performance.

It is yet to be trialed anywhere but looks interesting enough that it should be
trialed and therefore resides in assess.
