[Continuous Deployment](https://resources.github.com/devops/fundamentals/ci-cd/deployment/)
builds on continuous integration and continuous delivery by automating the entire
deployment pipeline.
Once a code change passes all required tests it is immediately shipped to
customers with no manual intervention.

The concept requires extensive and advanced automation of deployment pipelines
and may not be the right fit for some projects.
It is something to watch while DevOps experience is built up.
