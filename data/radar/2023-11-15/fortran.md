[Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/) is a statically-typed, compiled programming
language generally associated with high-performance scientific computing
libraries.

Fortran continues to be developed as a language but in many circumstances it has
been replaced by C++ or more recently Rust or Python with compiled internal
libraries. It is also more difficult to recruit developers with Fortran skills
and for these reasons we place it in the hold ring.
