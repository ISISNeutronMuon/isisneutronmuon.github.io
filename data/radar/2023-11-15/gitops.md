[GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops) uses Git
repositories as the source of truth for infrastructure code. Code is reviewed
and checked by CI processes in the same way as application code. Further tools
build on the configuration as code to support CI/CD to enable reliable
infrastructure management.

It is being trialed along with ArgoCD so is placed in the trial ring.
