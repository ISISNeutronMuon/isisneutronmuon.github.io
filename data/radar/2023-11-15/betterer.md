[Betterer](https://phenomnomnominal.github.io/betterer/) allows Node.js-based
projects to create metrics to define quality goals along with an aim at how
this metric should change over time. The library integrates with pre-commmit
hooks and CI and tracks trends in the defined metrics.

We have placed this in assess as we consider it worth watching but no one has
trialed it yet to gain any real experience with it.
