description: |
  [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a small web framework for Python.
  In contrast to Django it has very little built-in concepts such as database
  abstractions but relies on third-party libraries to provide these features.

It's simplicity makes it easy to learn and understand. It currently resides in
assess as we are not aware of anyone using it but it is worthy of trialing.
