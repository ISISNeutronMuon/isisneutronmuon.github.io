  [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com) is an alternative to Kafka for open-source
  event streaming platform. It offers Kafka-compatible APIs, written in C++, to
  support higher throughput that with Apache Kafka. The other key difference is
  that Zookeeper is not required for coordination of multiple brokers, as it is
  with versions of Kafka up to 3.3 thereby simplifying deployments.
