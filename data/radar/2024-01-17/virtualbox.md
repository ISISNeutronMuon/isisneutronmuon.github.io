description: |
  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a desktop virtualisation
  technology for running guest operating systems from within a host. [Guest
  additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html) are required to be
  installed inside the guest VM to enable certain pieces of functionality.
---

The core product and guest additions are free to use and licensed under the
GPLv3. An extension pack, distinct from the guest additions, is licensed
separately and should not be used without an appropriate Oracle license. While
desktop virtualisation is still useful, particularly for desktop environments,
it is recommended that container-based solutions are explored first.
We continue to place this adopt until it is clearer that it is no longer useful.
