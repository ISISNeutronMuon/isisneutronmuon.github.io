description: |
  [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) is a UI wireframing tool that produces
  low-fidelity wireframes when prototyping UI design.
  The low-fidelity nature of the mockups enables rapid prototyping and shifts
  the focus from styling and details to structure and content of the screens
  and how they interact.

It is in active use across ICD with licences available should they be required
so it has been placed it in adopt.
