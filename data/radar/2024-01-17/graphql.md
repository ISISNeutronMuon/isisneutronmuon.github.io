  [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is a query language for APIs enabling a client
  to specify exactly what data they would like to fetch. It is contrasted with REST
  APIs where calls to multiple endpoints, each returning a full response, are made.

A GraphQL API is under development in the Proposal & Allocations system so we have
placed this in trial.
