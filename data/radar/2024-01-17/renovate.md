  [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) is a dependency scanner that includes
  the ability to automatically update dependencies and create pull requests for
  review by a developer. It supports many
  [popular languages](https://docs.renovatebot.com/bazel).

GitHub also offer [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) with a similar
philosophy. It is worth assessing if Renovate offers anything extra ontop of
Dependabot.
