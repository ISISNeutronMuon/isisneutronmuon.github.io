## Rings

- *Adopt* represents blips that the division has had good experience with and
  would recommend using them on an appropriate project.
- *Trial* represents blips that we do not have direct experience with but they
  are being adopted by the industry and are being trialing with limited scope.
- *Assess* represents blips that look interesting and we want to keep an eye on
  them. They have not been trialed but would be good candidates for a
  "Try It Out Day".
- *Hold* represents blips that might be proven and accepted by industry but our
  given past experience we would not recommend them on new projects. Existing
  projects still need to be supported and a blip in hold should not be a sole
  decision for scrapping a project.
