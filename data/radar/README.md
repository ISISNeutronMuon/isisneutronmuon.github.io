# Technology Radar

## Rings

**Hold**\
  Generally it advised not to start anything new with this technology/technique.
  Existing projects still need to be supported and a blip in hold should not be a sole decision for scrapping a project.

**Assess**\
  A technology or technique that looks interesting and is worth some investment
  of effort to understand how it may impact the division and ISIS.
  They are good candidates for a "Try It Out Day".

**Trial**\
  A technology or technique that is worth pursuing and trialing on a
  low-risk project. A trial project should have begun before a blip is placed
  in this ring.

**Adopt**\
  A strong recommendation that this should be adopted assuming it is appropriate
  for a given project.
