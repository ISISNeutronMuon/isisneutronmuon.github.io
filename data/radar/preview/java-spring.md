description: |
  [Java Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
  is an application and inversion-of-control framework for Java. Extensions are
  available for writing web applications along with
  [Sprint Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for an opinionated view
  of how applications should be configured.

Favoured over Jakarta EE as it is considered simpler to use so we have
placed it in adopt.
