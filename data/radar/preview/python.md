[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose interpreted programming
language. It has an emphasis on readability and is considered an easier language
to learning programming concepts as the code can be executed directly without
a compilation step. It regularly features in the top 5 programming languages
used by developers around the world.

It is ubiquitous within the scientific computing arena where performance is also
a critical factor. Many libraries have been written in system languages wrapped
with a Python API to strike a balance between usability and performance.

The latest Python 3.x version should be chosen depending on the available
support of third-party libraries. In the case of writing a library for others
to consume consider what is the latest version users are able to use along
with the availability of package managers such as
[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) &
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html).

**Python 2.x** should not be used. Any code running in this version should
considered a security risk and a migration plan for this code should be created.
