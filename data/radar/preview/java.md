description: |
  [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is a high-level programming language that is
  statically typed and garbage collected.
  The language compiles to a bytecode that is agnostic of the target platform
  and requires a Java Virtual Machine to run on the target platform.

If starting a new project then Java 17 should be considered the minimum version
to adopt and newer if possible. Projects using older versions should form
a migration plan, particularly if Java 8 is still in active use.
