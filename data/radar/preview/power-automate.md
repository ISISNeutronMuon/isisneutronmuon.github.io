[Power Platform](https://make.powerapps.com) enables the development of low-code
solutions backed either by custom data sources or Microsoft-hosted cloud services.
Power Automate supports workflow automation, e.g. email notifications, across
all power platform projects.

Organizationally we are bought into the M365 ecosystem and power automate is
already widely used by the Scientific Software Support team to automate
many tasks behind the scenes of many SharePoint sites.
