[Python 2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.0/) is an unupported
version of the Python programming language. The final version was released
in April 2020 and it no longer receives security updates.

New projects should use Python 3 and not Python 2 as Python 2 is out of support
and Python 3 contained breaking API changes.
