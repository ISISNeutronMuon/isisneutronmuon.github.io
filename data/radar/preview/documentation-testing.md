Documentation testing is a general term for automatically verifying
example code where it appears in library documentation.

It is particularly strongly used within the Python community where the
[documentation tooling](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html)
supports executing, verifying and reporting on the status of tests.
