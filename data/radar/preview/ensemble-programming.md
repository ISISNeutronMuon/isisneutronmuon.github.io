[Ensemble Programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/),
also known as Mob programming, is the practice of the whole development team
working on a single problem at the same time. Originally the team would gather
around a single computer but with the advent of remote working, tools providing
shared coding environments have become popular.

We choose the adopt ring as the practice has many benefits such as knowledge transfer,
just-in-time code review, decreased context switching and has worked well in
teams that have trialed it.
