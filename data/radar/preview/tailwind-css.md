[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a framework that supplies CSS classes
to be composed together directly within markup rather than separating style
definitions into either out of line definitions or separate style files.
CSS files are still shipped to the browser but these are now products of the
tailwind compiler and not maintained by hand.

This radar is is developed with Tailwind so we have placed it in the trail ring.
