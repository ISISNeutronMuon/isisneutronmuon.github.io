  [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is
  a programming style that places an emphaisis on immutable state and composition
  of functions to achieve a certain goal. Functional languages such as F#, Haskell,
  have first-class support for functions but many languages have sufficient
  features to use a functional style.

It is a widely accepted paradigm and should be adopted where appropriate.
