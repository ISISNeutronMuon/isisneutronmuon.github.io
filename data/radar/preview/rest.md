[REST](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rest-architecture) is a style of architecture
that constrains an API to follow a set of RESTful principles:

- Uniform interface
- Stateless
- Layered
- Cacheability
- Code on demand

It is a well-established style and should be a strong consideration when
considering implementing an API. As an example the Auth team have developed
a RESTful API.
