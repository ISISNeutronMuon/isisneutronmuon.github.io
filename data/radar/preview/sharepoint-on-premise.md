[SharePoint On-Premise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/sharepoint-licensing-overview)
is a version of SharePoint that can be deployed on an ogranization's own hardware.

Due to the maintenance burden a shift to a cloud-hosted solution is in progress
and the on-premise version will eventually be retired. No new projects should
be started here.
