  [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/) is a free and open server-side data
  processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources,
  optionally transforming it, and then sending it to a "stash".

Despite recent licensing changes around Elasticsearch, Logstash remains free and widely
used for collection of log data. It also fits with OpenSearch and those currently
using Elasticsearch are likely to migrate to OpenSearch.
