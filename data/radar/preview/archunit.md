  [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) is a library for checking the architecture
  of your Java application. It is able to use any Java unit testing framework and
  amongst others checks for:

  - dependencies between packages and classes
  - layers and slicing
  - cyclic dependencies
---

It is a widely used framework for automating architecture rules so we have placed
it in adopt.
