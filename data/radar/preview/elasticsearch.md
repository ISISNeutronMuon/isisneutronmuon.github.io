  engine with a web interface and typically formed part of the ELK
  (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) stack.

Due to licensing changes in 2021 Elasticsearch was forked to a new project
called OpenSearch that remains under the original Apache 2.0 open-source license.
Complications around licensing mean Elasticsearch has been placed in hold and
it is suggested to continue using OpenSearch.
