[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a fork of the Elasticsearch tool by
Amazon after changes to the Elasticsearch licensing model. OpenSearch continues
to be developed under an open-source license and supports the same search and
analytics capabilities as the original Elasticsearch.

Opensearch is currently being trialed by the Risks, Samples and Scheduling team.
