[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is an alternative Python linter aimed at
boosting performance of Python linting over something like flake8. It is written
in Rust and combines a myriad of traditional linters into single package.

It is seen as stable by many projects and has been adopted by the Data Reduction
team.
