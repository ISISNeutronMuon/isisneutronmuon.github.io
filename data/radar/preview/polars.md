  [Polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/) is a library providing a
  DataFrame structure and operations much like Pandas. It is written as a
  Rust crate and also proviedes a Python API on top.

A robust tool, including support for a variety of different file formats
that is useful for any ad-hoc analysis so it is in adopt.
If performance is key consider trying Polars and falling back to Pandas
if Polars lacks support for the use case.
