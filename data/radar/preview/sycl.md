[SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/) defines C++, C++17 is a minimum, abstractions
to enable heterogeneous device programming. A major goal of SYCL is to enable different
heterogeneous devices to be used in a single application, for example
simultaneous use of CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs; without the need to write low-level
kernel code for a particular device.

This is not in active use by any one within the division but is interesting
enough that it has been placed in assess.
