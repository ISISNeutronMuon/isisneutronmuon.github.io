[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) is a large-language model (LLM) capable
of providing answers to complex questions posed with natural language. It is
able to process text, images and more recently with voice.

Access to the model is provided through:

- a web-based chat client.
- an API with bindings available for many populate languages.

Currently used mostly for ad-hoc queries during development. For this reason it
is currently in trial.
