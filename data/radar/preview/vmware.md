[VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/uk.html) is a virtualisation platform for both
desktop and server hardware.
[VMWare Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-player.html)
is a free version of the desktop software that does not offer any kind of support.

It is adopted for virtualisation on server hardware but less so for desktop
virtualisation where Virtualbox is preferred. While desktop virtualisation is
still useful, particularly for desktop environments, it is recommended that
container-based solutions are explored first.
We continue to place this adopt until it is clearer that it is no longer useful.
