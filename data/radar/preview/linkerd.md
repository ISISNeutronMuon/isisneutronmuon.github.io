[Linkerd](https://linkerd.io) is a service mesh for Kubernetes. It allows for
adding observability, security and reliability features to Kubernetes deployments
without having to alter the running application code.

The continuing push of applications to the cloud and Kubernetes means that these
types of technology should be assessed with interest in relation to our own
cloud deployments.
