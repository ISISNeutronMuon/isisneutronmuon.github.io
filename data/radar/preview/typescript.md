  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) adds additional syntax to
  JavaScript allowing for strong typing. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript so that
  no additional tools are required to run the code on the client side. Typing also
  allows for better integration with code completion in editors.

Widely adopt by all projects using JavaScript as a language so it resides in the
adopt ring.
