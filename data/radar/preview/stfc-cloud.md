The [STFC Cloud](https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/overview) is an
internal, private cloud-computing service developed and maintained by the
Scientific Computing Department. Based on Openstack, it offers similar services
to public cloud offerings such as compute, block storage, object storage,
load balancers etc. ISIS funds hardware in the cloud both directly and through
the IRIS project.

A mature platform running production workloads across STFC including many projects
across the division. It is recommended that new and existing projects investigate
the suitability of the STFC cloud before looking to ISIS-based hardware
solutions.
