[C++](https://isocpp.org/) is a compiled, statically-typed, general-purpose
systems programming language. Traditionally used when runtime performance is
critical, however difficulties with writing memory-safe code have seen competitors
such as Rust gaining traction in this space.

It is encouraged that projects adopt the latest version of the standard supported
by the compilers that are available.
[C++23](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/23) is the latest published version of
the standard however this is unlikely to have widespread support at this time.
There is widespread
[compiler support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/17) for
C++17 so it is recommended that this be the minimum version of the
language to support and nothing older.
