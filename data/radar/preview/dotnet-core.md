An open-source, cross-platform managed framework for developing applications.
Code runs in a managed runtime and the framework provides many class libraries
for achieving common programming tasks such as networking and databases.
It is a successor to the
[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework).

While the .NET Framework is still in use across the division it's not clear that
.NET Core is the natural next step in migration so this remains in the assess
ring.
