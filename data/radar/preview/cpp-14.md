[C++](https://isocpp.org/) is a compiled, statically-typed, general-purpose
systems programming language. Traditionally used when runtime performance is
critical, however difficulties with writing memory-safe code have seen competitors
such as Rust gaining traction in this space.

[C++14](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17) is a version of the ISO standard
for C++ released in 2014. It has been superseded by newer versions and compiler
support for these later standards means that C++14 and older standards should be
considered unsupported and not targeted unless needed. We therefore place this
in hold.
