  [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)(DDD) is
  the practice of designing and architecting software that breaks down the system
  according to aspects of the problem domain rather than grouping elements by
  their technical association.

DDD couples very well with a microservices architecture where each subdomain
is isolated as separate service that then communicate as whole. It is widely
adopted by industry and across the division so sits in adopt.
