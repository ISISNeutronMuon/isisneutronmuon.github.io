[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), also known as K8s, is an open-source system
for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic and can run in any of the public clouds but also
within the STFC cloud.
Kubernetes has been adopted by many teams who all use it to deploy their
containerized applications through the STFC cloud.
