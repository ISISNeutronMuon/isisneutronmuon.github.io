[.NET Framework 4x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)
is a proprietrary framework for building Windows desktop and server-based
applications.
Code runs in a managed runtime and the framework provides many class libraries
for achieving common programming tasks such as networking and databases.

The final version of .NET framwork has been released with no further updates
planned. All future updates in the .NET space will be made as part of the
cross-platform [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) project. .NET framework
therefore resides in the hold ring.
