  [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/) is a cross-platform, C++ application framework primarily
  used for writing cross-platform graphical user interfaces, also supporting
  embedded devices.

---

Qt 6 is the latest major version and it is recommended that this be adopted if
possible but note that Qt 6 requires a relatively modern Linux distribution,
for example Red Hat >= 8.4, so if support for an older Linux OS is required then
Qt 5 is still available or consider running the application in a container.

Qt is written in C++ but there are also Python bindings, e.g.
[PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/), available for writing
applications in Python that are backed by the Qt framework.
