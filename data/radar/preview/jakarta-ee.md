description: |
  [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/), formerly Java EE, specifies a set of features
  extending the standard Java specification with additional features for enterprise
  requirements such as distributed computing and web services.

While EE is a complete specification the consensus has been that Java Spring
provides an easier to use framework, especially when coupled with Spring Boot.
We therefore place this in hold.
