[C++](https://isocpp.org/) is a compiled, statically-typed, general-purpose
systems programming language. Traditionally used when runtime performance is
critical, however difficulties with writing memory-safe code have seen competitors
such as Rust gaining traction in this space.

[C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17) is a version of the ISO standard
for C++ released in 2017. There is widespread
[compiler support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/17) for
this version so it is recommended that this be the minimum version of the
language to support.

It is primarily used by the Data Reduction team within the Scientific Software
group.
