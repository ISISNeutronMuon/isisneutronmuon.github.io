[Test-Driven Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/) is a method
of software development that encourages a style of coding where:

- a unit test is first created for a feature that does not exist
- the unit test is executed and it fails
- minimal code is written that causes the test to pass
- refactor code for [simplicity](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/rules-of-simplicity/).

This loop is repeated and a suite a tests builds over time.

This is a well-known software development tool that is practiced across the division
so sits in adopt.
