[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is a purely functional, statically-typed
programming language. Side-effects are not allowed within functions thereby
lending itself to well to concurrent programming tasks.

Like Clojure this could be a useful too for gaining a better understanding of
the concepts of functional programming that are useful to appreciate themselves.
